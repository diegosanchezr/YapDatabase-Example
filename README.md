YapDatabase-Example
===================

A small example project for using YapDatabase. Uses [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) for bringing in the source. A contrived example at the moment, but should be able to get you started. You can just download the repo as a zip file(or fork it, if you want to make improvements) and run it as is.
